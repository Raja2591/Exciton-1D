# Exciton-1D

I have been modelling the Frenkel Exciton Theory and the Polaron Theory and we have developed some fundamental differences between and Exction and a polaron

Some major differences are:

1. The ground state of the polaron is the lowest eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian. This is very different from the Frenkel Exciton theory where the ground state is simply the state where all the chromophores are unexcited.

2. The total oscillator strength for a polaron absorption is not conserved with changing disorder, in marked contrast to Exciton theory where a loss in oscillator strength in one spectral region is compensated by an increase in oscillator strength in another.

3. Because the ground states are different, polaron absorption and exciton absorption is affected differently by disorder. Fro example, exciton absortion is severely affected by LL disorder (please look into the reference below to learn about LL disorder) while polaron absorption is unchanged.
